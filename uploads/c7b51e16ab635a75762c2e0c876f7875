The purpose of the telephone conference will be for the Court to gather current information such as number of jurors, motions in limine, length of trial and potential alternative dispute resolution.  Following the conference, the Civil Court will meet to determine the assignment of trials to judges and dates to commence trial.  Prior to the telephone conference, litigating counsel must communicate with each other and be prepared to give the following information to the Court during the telephone conference:

 

1.            Current status of offer and demand.

 

2.            Factual issues in dispute, factual issues agreed upon, unusual legal issues and anticipated Motions in Limine.

 

3.            The length of the trial and the reason for same (including jury selection).

 

4.            The likelihood of settlement.  If the parties, after consultation with their clients, represent that a settlement conference with a Judge would likely facilitate a settlement, counsel should contact Chambers right away so that a settlement conference may be scheduled.

 

5.            Whether 8 jurors is acceptable.  If either party insists on a panel of 12, counsel shall confirm to the Court the written demand for twelve of record.  Please see Bucks County Local Rule 254.   

 

Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s mandate of February 14, 2023, no further continuances will be granted for cases that have been pending and for which multiple prior continuances were granted except for compelling circumstances set forth in a Petition requesting a continuance.

 

It is critical that counsel has spoken to one another and their respective clients prior to the telephone conference and that counsel are prepared to give accurate information during the telephone conference.  Requiring Bucks County citizens to come to the Justice Center to be voir dired is something our Court and counsel should not take lightly.  If you are going to require a Jury Trial to resolve your dispute, you must be prepared and ready to go when called.  The Court seeks to prioritize those taking time away from their daily lives serving as jurors, not the litigants or their counsel.  

 

Kindly reply to this email with the telephone number where you may be reached at the time of the telephone conference.  

 

Thank you.

Below is the link for the Zoom remote deposition.   

 

If you never used Zoom and would like to test, please let me know. We recommend doing this test in the same location and using the same device you will be using during the deposition.  It will be very important to have a reliable internet connection. 

 

 

Also, If there are exhibits you wish to present during the deposition, there is a ""Screen Share"" function that we can have a technician test with you as well. 

 

 

Thank you.

 

*** Please forward this link to all who should attend. ***

Donna please confirm that you received this invitation for a zoom meeting next Friday morning at 10 AM.

If you'll remember, I did an interview with you in June 2022 when you are starting a job at Vanguard. I need to update all of your information, both medical and vocational and likely financial as well. So we will have quite a bit of ground to cover. Just to let you know where we left off, so to speak, I will send you a copy of the report I sent to your attorney Jeff Lessin. Please review that it will help immensely when we are discussing what has changed in the past year and 1/2.

If you need to reach me for any reason my cell phone is 215-805-3320

Also, If there are exhibits you wish to present during the deposition, there is a ""Screen Share"" function that we can have a technician test with you as well. 

 

 

Thank you.

Hello All, 

 

Below is the link for the August 3, 2022 Zoom remote deposition.   

 

 If you never used Zoom and would like to test, please let me know. We recommend doing this test in the same location and using the same device you will be using during the deposition.  It will be very important to have a reliable internet connection. 

 

 

Also, If there are exhibits you wish to present during the deposition, there is a ""Screen Share"" function that we can have a technician test with you as well. 

 

 

Thank you.

With the continuation of multiple Jury Trials happening here in Burlington County and our continued use of Zoom for Conferences and Case Management Conferences, matters have been scheduled back-to-back in order for conferences to continue. To make things easier for virtual hearings on Monday, June 13, 2022, the conferences scheduled will be via Zoom.

 

With that being said, I have not only included the Zoom link below, but have also listed each matter and the time when it is scheduled to be heard. Please see what time your matter is scheduled and sign on at that time. If by chance Judge Belgard is running a bit longer on a CMC, please be patient and you will be admitted when your matter is ready to be heard. 

 

9:30        Scott v. Mycone, L-2235-20 – CMC (moved from 9:00am)

10:00     Calaiero v. Chatyrka, L-882-21/Calaiaro v. Shar, L-345-22 – CMC

BUR.VTC03@njcourts.gov <mailto:BUR.VTC03@njcourts.gov>   is inviting you to a scheduled NJCourts Virtual Courtroom.

 

Please be advised that only recognized email addresses &/or devices will be allowed entry into the Zoom hearings.  Should you require entry with another device – Ipad, cellular phone, etc – please let Court staff know in advance of the hearing.  In the alternative, you may wish to rename the device when you attempt to join the meeting to avoid this issue.

 

If there are multiple cases involved, we need to limit the number of members in the hearings.  Once you are done participating in hearing events, you must leave the meeting or the moderator will remove you from the meeting.  

 

If the court event is streamed, and wish to see what is occurring, you may watch via the weblink (www.njcourts.gov/public/channels.html <http://www.njcourts.gov/public/channels.html> )  as opposed to viewing live in the room.

 

Thank you in advance for your understanding and patience.

Hello All, 

 

Below is the link for the April 26, 2022 Zoom remote deposition.   

 

 If you never used Zoom and would like to test, please let me know. We recommend doing this test in the same location and using the same device you will be using during the deposition.  It will be very important to have a reliable internet connection. 

 

 

Also, If there are exhibits you wish to present during the deposition, there is a ""Screen Share"" function that we can have a technician test with you as well. 

 

 

Thank you.

 

*** Please forward this link to all who should attend. ***

Jeff,

 

I spoke with Linda from Dr. Mark Allen's office. I asked her for the price for Dr. Allen to do a med review and comprehensive report. She said there is nothing up front and it will be put on at the end of settlement. Linda wanted to know if we wanted Nadine to go in for a visit or for him to just do the report. 

 

Please advise us on how we should handle this.

 

Thanks.

You can access this Zoom mediation session by using the following information:

https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82251900158

Meeting ID: 822 5190 0158

 

Attendees.  We believe that the appropriate parties with full settlement authority will be in attendance.  Please be sure to let your clients know to leave the day wide open so that there are no artificial impediments to settlement, and so we can go as long as is necessary to arrive at a resolution. Please send us the names and cell phone numbers of all who will be attending a mediation session. 

 

 

Pre-Mediation Statements.  We will look to receive your confidential pre-mediation statements on or before April 27th.  Generally, it is good to provide a brief statement of key facts, law only to the extent that it is pivotal to the negotiation or to assessment of the matter, information on inter-party dynamics, thoughts for settlement, settlement history, pertinent correspondence or agreements, and thoughts on how best to structure the mediation session(s).  You are encouraged to include and annex any other information that you think would be helpful in bringing us up to speed.    

 

Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in the interim.


Many thanks and best regards.

This letter confirms you are scheduled for a remote settlement conference  via Zoom on 3/18/22 at 3:30pm.

Your court event has been designated to be held remotely via Zoom. This is your electronic invitation (evite) with instructions on how to join your assigned event.  As a remote event, your physical presence at the courthouse is not required, therefore, you will not be permitted access to court facilities on the day your matter is scheduled to be heard. If you are experiencing witness conflicts, do not have access to the required technology to participate remotely, or are requesting your matter be adjourned, you must contact the Division in which your matter is assigned to have the issue resolved and for further instructions. The protection and health and safety of the public, our employees and judges, are our paramount concern.
Please be advised that only recognized email addresses &/or devices will be allowed entry into the Zoom hearings.  Should you require entry with another device – Ipad, cellular phone, etc – please let Court staff know in advance of the hearing.  In the alternative, you may wish to rename the device when you attempt to join the meeting to avoid this issue.

If there are multiple cases involved, we need to limit the number of members in the hearings.  Once you are done participating in hearing events, you must leave the meeting or the moderator will remove you from the meeting.  

If the court event is streamed, and wish to see what is occurring, you may watch via the weblink (www.njcourts.gov/public/channels.html <http://www.njcourts.gov/public/channels.html> ) as opposed to viewing live in the room.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and patience.
Please forward the link to all pro-se parties and counsel participating in the conference.

Subject: Re: Wenhold v. Wawa

Counsel - This will formally confirm my appointment as arbitrator in this matter. I am happy to accept this appointment and I appreciate your confidence in me. 

This will also confirm that the case is scheduled for arbitration Tuesday February 1, 2022 starting at 10am. Please set aside this date and time on your calendar  for this purpose. We will proceed virtually with details to follow.

Because I continue to work remotely and because I don’t have access to a decent copier, please arrange to have your trial submissions delivered to me both by email and by Hard Copy to where I am hiding out: 37 Wesley Road, Ocean City N J 08226. I have found that FedEx or equivalent works best; USPS Not so much. I would like to have your submissions no later than January 26.

I look forward to working with you toward the disposition of this case. Best. Pete

When: Thursday, September 23, 2021 12:00 AM to Friday, September 24, 2021 12:00 AM (UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada).
Where: office 


As of 09/16/2021  Russ stated that Jessica McClendon and her father no longer speak to each other and he doesn’t know her current address.
What is the next step for this one? 

As of 09/02/2021 when I emailed Russell was looking into this and looking up the address in Chicago. I will follow up and see if he found anything. 


I emailed RUSS for an update and will follow up with him in a week as we are stuck on getting an address or insurance company.


In Addition, RUSS is looking into this so we if we can get a better address as well. I will follow-up with RUSS.

We are researching the Illnois Department of motor vehicles to see if the owners of the vehicle Diane Baker and Hazel Garnett have insurance or UIM per allen.
I tried to call and wasn’t able to get through. I am putting in an inquiry in reference to this. Please see screenshot below:

This email came in on 11/8 the Case Management Conference in this email was not placed on the calendar for 11/22, even though no one attends we still need it in the calendar because that way Allen knows to prepare the Memo. The email with the Case Management date is not downloaded into file Center. I am saving it in there now. Please mark the calendar for a Case Management Conference on 11/22 (no attendance by counsel).  Counsel for defendant sent an email talking about it and  I checked the calendar for it but saw it was not there. Thank you.

Hello All,

Also, If there are exhibits you wish to present during the deposition, there is a ""Screen Share"" function that we can have a technician test with you as well. 

 

 

Thank you.

Counsel - This will formally confirm my appointment as arbitrator in this matter. I am happy to accept this appointment and I appreciate your confidence in me. 

This will also confirm that the case is scheduled for arbitration Tuesday February 1, 2022 starting at 10am. Please set aside this date and time on your calendar  for this purpose. We will proceed virtually with details to follow.

Because I continue to work remotely and because I don’t have access to a decent copier, please arrange to have your trial submissions delivered to me both by email and by Hard Copy to where I am hiding out: 37 Wesley Road, Ocean City N J 08226.
